# SVM-23100733-
Applying Support Vector Machines (SVM) to the Iris Dataset

Description:
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model applied to the Iris dataset is implemented and analysed in this Jupyter Notebook. Data preprocessing, model training, assessment, and visualisation are all included.

Installation specifications:
The following requirements must be installed in order for you to use this notebook:
Python(>=3.7)
Jupyter Nootbook
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn

Installing the necessary libraries can be done with:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

Use:
1.Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook SVM(23100733).ipynb
2.To preprocess data, train the model, and examine the outcomes, run the cells one after the other.

Contents of:
1.Preparing the data: loading and sanitising the Iris dataset
2.Model Training: Using several kernels to train an SVM classifier
3.Hyperparameter tuning: Finding the ideal parameters using grid search
4.Model accuracy, confusion matrix, and performance measures are used for evaluation.
5.Visualisation: Distributions of features and decision boundaries
